<p>
YDN-DB Javascript database module is a wrapper for next generation browser standard client side storage <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/" >IndexedDB</a>, supporting version migration advanced query and transaction. Learning from our web development experience, this API is designed to be simple and concise while flexible down to native API access. We tried hard to make this module so that it has best performance possible without compromising security and flexibility. Performance and capability for using this API is the same as if you were using browser native IndexedDB API directly. </p><p>For browser that not supported IndexedDB, WebSQL and localStorage storage mechanisms are substituted as much possible. We don't take advantage of WebSQL features. We don't have not much to say about localStorage, since it is not usable for large scale high performance storage. We included it as for completeness.</p>

<p>In the future, we will provide synchronizing with remote database secure bearer token based authorization and secure session. </p></div></div>
